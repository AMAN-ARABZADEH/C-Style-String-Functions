# C-Style String and Character Manipulation in C++

This repository contains a code snippet that demonstrates the usage of various C-style string functions and character manipulation functions in C++. 
It showcases different operations such as string initialization, length calculation, copying, concatenation, comparison, character access, searching, tokenization,
and character classification.



## Examples C-Style String Functions

- `strlen()`: Calculates the length of a string.
- `strcpy()`: Copies a string.
- `strcat()`: Concatenates two strings.
- `strcmp()`: Compares two strings.
- `strchr()`: Searches for a character in a string.
- `strstr()`: Searches for a substring in a string.
- `strtok()`: Tokenizes a string.
- `isalpha()`: Checks if a character is alphabetic.
- `isdigit()`: Checks if a character is a digit.
- `isalnum()`: Checks if a character is alphanumeric.
- `isspace()`: Checks if a character is a whitespace character.
- `tolower()`: Converts a character to lowercase.
- `toupper()`: Converts a character to uppercase.
- `islower()`: Checks if a character is lowercase.
- `isupper()`: Checks if a character is uppercase.
- `isxdigit()`: Checks if a character is a hexadecimal digit.
- `isprint()`: Checks if a character is a printable character.
- `ispunct()`: Checks if a character is a punctuation character.
- `iscntrl()`: Checks if a character is a control character.
